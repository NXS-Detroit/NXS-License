# The NXS License
Welcome to the license for NXS files! The license applies to real life, unlike other files which may pretend the system actually exists. These are the terms I'll require you to follow when using any NXS information in your own projects.

# Definitions of terms
* First-person singular pronouns like "I" mean the GitHub and Twitter user ShadowFoxNixill, the creator of NXS.
* Second-person pronouns like "You" mean the entity that wishes to create a derivative work based on NXS.
* First-person plural pronouns like "Us" mean, collectively, You and Me.

# NXS Ideas
"NXS Ideas" are the ideas for routes, schedules, vehicles, locations, etc. of bus service within the universe in which NXS exists. The term also includes files used to express such ideas, for example the [OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/NXS-Detroit/NXS-OpenStreetMap)-format and [General Transit Feed Specification](https://github.com/NXS-Detroit/NXS-GTFS)-format files in their respective repositories.

NXS ideas are licensed under a [Creative Commons-Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), with the following additional restrictions:

* You **MUST NOT** attempt to present NXS ideas as non-fictional. You **MUST NOT** attempt to convince anyone that it is non-fictional.
  * You **MAY** pretend it exists within your derivative works. In those circumstances, it **MUST** be clear that you're pretending.
  * If it's unclear whether your use violates this section, [contact me on twitter](https://twitter.com/ShadowFoxNixill) and we'll work it out.
  * If you have the means and desire to *cause* NXS - or parts of it - to be non-fictional, [also contact me](https://twitter.com/ShadowFoxNixill).
* You **SHOULD**, not **MUST**, contact me to inform me of your derivative works. I want to know, but it is not a requirement.

# NXS Code
"NXS Code" is any software on the NXS Detroit GitHub. Such software will be rare; most code I make will be released under [my own personal github](https://github.com/ShadowFoxNixill), even code which is used to create files for NXS.

This license only applies to code released as being written by NXS Detroit, and only that which links back to this license from its own repository.
